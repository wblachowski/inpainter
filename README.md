# Inpainter ðŸ–Œ
A simple PoC Android application performing the task on inpainting on a given image. It accepts an image from your phone's gallery or a picture taken using the camera, allows you to paint over it, and then feeds the image through a neural network to fill the marked space.
It was trained specifically to perform the task on human faces.

## Results
Results for images similar to the training samples look relatively good.

  <img src="assets/1.jpg" width="40%"/>
  <img src="assets/2.jpg" width="40%"/> 
</p>
<p float="right">
  <img src="assets/3.jpg" width="40%"/>
  <img src="assets/4.jpg" width="40%"/> 
</p>

For images differing more from the training dataset (be it in lightning, crop, perspective, quality etc.), the results are less perfect, and can even be quite creepy at times.
